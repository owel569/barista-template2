Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'string' can't be used to index type '{ café: ForwardRefExoticComponent<Omit<LucideProps, "ref"> & RefAttributes<SVGSVGElement>>; ... 17 more ...; glaces: ForwardRefExoticComponent<...>; }'. No index signature with a parameter of type 'string' was found on type '{ café: ForwardRefExoticComponent<Omit<LucideProps, "ref"> & RefAttributes<SVGSVGElement>>; ... 17 more ...; glaces: ForwardRefExoticComponent<...>; }'.

Type '{ children: Element[]; value: "none" | "bar" | "indoor" | "outdoor" | "window" | "private" | undefined; onValueChange: (value: "none" | "bar" | "indoor" | "outdoor" | "window" | "private") => void; }' is not assignable to type '{ value?: string; defaultValue?: string; onValueChange?(value: string): void; }' with 'exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true'. Consider adding 'undefined' to the types of the target's properties. Types of property 'value' are incompatible. Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'. Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.
